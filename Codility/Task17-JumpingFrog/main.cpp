 * A small frog wants to get from position 0 to k (1 <= k <= 10 000). The frog can
 * jump over any one of n fixed distances s_0 , s_1 , . . . , s_(nâˆ’1) (1 <= s_i <= k). The goal is to count the
 * number of different ways in which the frog can jump to position k. To avoid overflow, it is
 * sufficient to return the result modulo q, where q is a given number.
 * We assume that two patterns of jumps are different if, in one pattern, the frog visits
 * a position which is not visited in the other pattern.
